# Arduino-RFM69HCW-GPS

I stand on the shoulder of giants.

My code/sketches are built on previously shared code by three other contributers.  They are noted at the top at each arduino sketch.

Supported board I created and shared at:  https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/vCLw90ht

These sketches may also work with the adafruit feather M0 with the noted pin changes.  I do not have one and could not test.

Three modes supported, Morse, Feld Hell, and RTTY 5N1 170Hz.

Three sketches per mode.  1) a keyboard input mode, a raw beacon mode, and one that transmits GPS telemetry.
